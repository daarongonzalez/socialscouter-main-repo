# Security Audit Report

## Frontend Security

| Status | Security Measure | Description | Current State | Action Required |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| ‚òê | Use HTTPS everywhere | Prevents basic eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks | Development uses HTTP, production TBD | Configure HTTPS in production |
| ‚òê | Input validation and sanitization | Prevents XSS attacks by validating all user inputs | Basic Zod validation, no sanitization | Add DOMPurify for client-side sanitization |
| ‚òê | Don't store sensitive data in the browser | No secrets in localStorage or client-side code | API keys properly server-side | ‚úÖ Good |
| ‚òê | CSRF protection | Implement anti-CSRF tokens for forms and state-changing requests | No CSRF protection | Implement CSRF middleware |
| ‚òê | Never expose API keys in frontend | API credentials should always remain server-side | ‚úÖ All keys server-side | ‚úÖ Good |

## Backend Security

| Status | Security Measure | Description | Current State | Action Required |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| ‚òê | Authentication fundamentals | Use established libraries, proper password storage | Using Replit Auth (OAuth) | ‚úÖ Good |
| üö® | Authorization checks | Always verify permissions before performing actions | **CRITICAL: /api/batch/:id has no auth** | **FIX IMMEDIATELY** |
| ‚òê | API endpoint protection | Implement proper authentication for every API endpoint | Most endpoints protected, one critical gap | Fix /api/batch/:id endpoint |
| ‚òê | SQL injection prevention | Use parameterized queries or ORMs | Using Drizzle ORM | ‚úÖ Good |
| ‚òê | Basic security headers | Implement X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS | No security headers | Add helmet.js middleware |
| ‚òê | DDoS protection | Use CDN or cloud service with DDoS mitigation | No rate limiting | Implement express-rate-limit |

## Practical Security Habits

| Status | Security Measure | Description | Current State | Action Required |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| ‚òê | Keep dependencies updated | Most vulnerabilities come from outdated libraries | Not audited | Run npm audit |
| üö® | Proper error handling | Don't expose sensitive details in error messages | **Detailed errors exposed** | **Sanitize error responses** |
| ‚òê | Secure cookies | Set HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite attributes | Using express-session defaults | Configure secure session options |
| ‚òê | File upload security | Validate file types, sizes, scan for malicious content | No file uploads | N/A |
| üö® | Rate limiting | Implement on all API endpoints | **No rate limiting** | **Add rate limiting middleware** |

## Additional Critical Issues Found

| Priority | Issue | Location | Risk Level | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| üö® | Authorization Bypass | `/api/batch/:id` | CRITICAL | Anyone can access any user's batch data by guessing IDs |
| üö® | Information Disclosure | Error responses | HIGH | Stack traces and internal errors exposed to clients |
| üö® | No Rate Limiting | All endpoints | HIGH | Vulnerable to DoS attacks and API abuse |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Missing Input Sanitization | URL inputs | MEDIUM | User URLs not sanitized before processing |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | No Security Headers | Express app | MEDIUM | Missing CORS, CSP, and other security headers |

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Do Now)
1. Fix authorization bypass on `/api/batch/:id` endpoint
2. Add rate limiting to all endpoints
3. Sanitize error responses
4. Add security headers

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (Next)
1. Add input sanitization
2. Configure secure session cookies
3. Add CSRF protection
4. Audit and update dependencies

### Phase 3: Production Security (Before Launch)
1. Configure HTTPS
2. Set up proper logging and monitoring
3. Security testing and penetration testing
4. Final security review
